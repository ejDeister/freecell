# Freecell 

> A standard 52 card game, akin to solitaire, where in the case of freecell, all cards are dealt face-up, and there are only a few small percentage of games played that are unsolvable.

## Rules

Game setup: The layout has eight cascades (tableaus), four open cells, and four foundations.

Cards are dealt face-up: four cascades have seven cards each, and four cascades have six cards each.

Goal: Move all cards to the four foundation piles, each built up in suit order from Ace to King.

How to build on the Tableau: Cards in cascades (tableaus) are built down by alternating colors (red on black, black on red). Only the top card of a cascade may be moved.

Cells: The four open cells each hold one card temporarily. A card in a cell can be moved to a tableau, an empty cascade, or a foundation.

Empty Spaces: An empty cascade can hold any single card (or a sequence, depending on free cells).
An empty cell can hold any single card.

When the game is won: The game is won when all cards are moved to the foundations in correct order.
